At the end of the loop you output an Answer.

Use Thought to understand the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Action_Response will be the result of running those actions.
if you don't have an action to run, you can output an Answer.

Your available actions are:

get_weather:
e.g. get_weather: California
Returns the current weather state for the city
